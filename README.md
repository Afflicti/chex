# chex
chex is a tool to quickly view .hex files in terminal

If you add the exe into your paths, you should be able to use it just like any other terminal command

## TODO:
- create help -h 
- create option to add start and end address to display only part of hex file
- add coloring of characters (hex codes of characers)
- check if checksum is correct
- print "metadata" of the hexfile
